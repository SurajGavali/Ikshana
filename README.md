There is always a challenge when developing a guiding system for blind people. There are many people who are suffering from visually impaired(VI) or blindness. These people face a lot of difficulties in their day to day activities. The most difficult task for them is moving in an unfamiliar world of which they have no idea whatâ€™s around them. Generally people rely on their visions to familiarise themselves with their surroundings around them. We are planning to build an android application which will allow these people who are visually impaired or Blind to move freely in their surroundings with ease. This will help the users to get an idea about what's around them to avoid possible collisions. This application also includes a face recognition system which will allow the user to identify the people around them using audio outputs. This application includes text detection , object detection and face recognition with the help of machine learning algorithms and data analytics concepts.
